              Indicates if the trip was a part of a shared ride chain offered by a
              High Volume FHV company (e.g. Uber Pool, Lyft Line). For shared
              trips, the value is 1. For non-shared rides, this field is null.
              NOTE: For most High Volume FHV companies, only shared rides that
              were requested AND matched to another shared-ride request over
              the course of the journey are flagged. However, Lyft (base license
              numbers B02510 + B02844) also flags rides for which a shared ride
              was requested but another passenger was not successfully matched
              to share the tripâ€”therefore, trips records with SR_Flag=1 from those
              two bases could indicate EITHER a first trip in a shared trip chain OR
              a trip for which a shared ride was requested but never matched.
              Users should anticipate an overcount of successfully shared trips
              completed by Lyft.
